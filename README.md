# Expected-Runs-Predictor
 We're sharing a model for predicting expected runs based on match context. Download the data, upload to Google Drive, open in Google Colab, run the code, input match details, and get expected runs for the current situation.
For my people here on Facebook, I have made expected runs model for each delivery seeing the context of the match. 
You can calculate it by yourself now. 
All you have to do is to download this data file ⬇️

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z4-M9pqZOOGQGJXZCYHEE7KTZyLbsk81/view?usp=drive_link

Upload it in your google drive. 

Then open google colab from Google or Chrome Browser. 

In google colab mount the notebook with your google drive. 

After that download the following file ⬇️


https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HMNhEMxTL4Q-bP2G9wvoXUhUjrag9rQ0?usp=drive_link

Copy all codes from second file and paste them into your own colab and run them. It will ask you to mount your google drive with colab notebook - make sure you already have uploaded the data file in drive. 

It will then ask you about inputs of three things, first thing will be innings Run Rate: put that seeing any match at the moment. 
Then it will ask you to input Number of Wickets fallen and then in third place it will ask you Number of Legal deliveries left; put that as well, it will then give you the expected runs on that nth delivery seeing the context.
